# 5 O'Clock Somewhere
>A simple app to make at-home hourly workflow easier and more organized

# Project Overview

***5 O'Clock Somewhere*** is an in-progress web-app dedicated to creating an easy way to clock in and clock out of work in an asynchronous work environment. As far as functionality, on top of clock in / clock out, the user will be prompted to tell what they did while on the clock. This information will be logged and accessible for both the project manager as well as the employee to be easily referenced. The employee will also be able to see total time worked via their profile.
